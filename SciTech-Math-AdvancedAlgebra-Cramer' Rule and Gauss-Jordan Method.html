<p><strong>VOCABULARY</strong>
ech¬∑e¬∑lon, | ÀàeSH…ôÀål√§n |,
<strong>noun</strong>
1. a level or rank in an organization, a profession, or society: the upper echelons of the business world.
2. Military a formation of troops, ships, aircraft, or vehicles in parallel rows with the end of each row projecting further than the one in front: the regiment lined up shoulder to shoulder in three tight echelons | [mass noun] : there are two planes, lying in echelon with one another.
  ‚Ä¢ [often with modifier] a part of a military force differentiated by position in battle or by function: the rear echelon.</p>
<p><strong>verb</strong> [with object] Military
arrange in an echelon formation: (as noun echeloning) : the echeloning of fire teams.
<strong>ORIGIN</strong>
late 18th century (in echelon (sense 2 of the noun)): from French √©chelon, from √©chelle ‚Äòladder‚Äô, from Latin scala.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong>
In this section you will learn to
* Represent <code>a system of linear equations</code> as <code>an augmented matrix</code>
* Solve the system using <code>elementary row operations</code>.</p>
<p>In this section, we learn to solve systems of linear equations using a process called the Gauss-Jordan method.
The process:
1. begins by first expressing the system as a matrix,
  we expressed the system of equations as  ùê¥ùëã=ùêµ , where:
    * ùê¥  represented the coefficient matrix,
    * ùêµ  the matrix of constant terms.
    * [ùê¥ùêµ] As an augmented matrix, we write the matrix as  [ùê¥ùêµ] .
    * It is clear that all of the information is maintained in this matrix form,
      and only the letters  ùë• , ùë¶  and  ùëß  are missing. A student may choose to write  ùë• ,  ùë¶  and  ùëß  on top of the first three columns to help ease the transition.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>and then reducing it to an equivalent system by simple row operations.
  Now we list the <code>three row operations</code> the <strong>Gauss-Jordan method</strong> employs. Row Operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any two rows</strong> in the augmented matrix <strong>may be interchanged</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Any row</strong> <strong>may be multiplied by a non-zero constant</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>A constant multiple of a row</strong> <strong>may be added to another row</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process is continued until the solution is obvious from the matrix.
   <strong>The <code>reduced row echelon form</code> of the coefficient matrix</strong>:
   has <code>1's along the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere</code>.
  The solution is readily obtained from this form.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>The matrix that represents the system</code> is called the <code>augmented matrix</code>,
  and <code>the arithmetic manipulation that is used to move</code>,
  from <code>a system</code> to <code>a reduced equivalent system</code> is called <code>a row operation</code>.</p>
<p>Once a system is expressed as an augmented matrix,
the <strong><code>Gauss-Jordan method</code></strong> <strong>reduces the system,
  into</strong> <code>a series of equivalent systems</code> by <code>using the row operations</code>.
 This <code>row reduction</code> continues until the system is expressed in what is called <strong><code>the reduced row echelon form</code></strong>.</p>
<p>The method is not much different form the algebraic operations we employed in the elimination method in the first chapter. The basic difference is that <code>it is algorithmic in nature</code>, <strong>and, therefore, can easily be programmed on a computer</strong>.</p>
<p>We will next solve a system of two equations with two unknowns, using the elimination method, and then show that the method is analogous to the Gauss-Jordan method.
<strong><code>Gauss-Jordan Method</code></strong>
* Write the augmented matrix.
* Interchange rows if necessary to obtain a non-zero number in the first row, first column.
* Use a row operation to get a 1 as the entry in the first row and first column.
  Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column one.
* Interchange rows if necessary to obtain a nonzero number in the second row, second column.
  Use a row operation to make this entry 1. Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column two.
* Repeat step 5 for row 3, column 3.
* Continue moving along the main diagonal until you reach the last row, or until the number is zero.
* The final matrix is called the <code>reduced row-echelon form</code>.</p>
<p>[<strong>9.8: Solving Systems with Cramer's Rule</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong>
* Evaluate 2 √ó 2 determinants.: Use Cramer‚Äôs Rule to solve a system of equations <strong>in two variables</strong>.
* Evaluate 3 √ó 3 determinants.: Use Cramer‚Äôs Rule to solve a system of three equations <strong>in three variables</strong>.
* Know <strong><code>the properties of determinants</code></strong>.
  <strong><code>PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS</code></strong>
    * If the matrix is in upper triangular form, the determinant equals the product of entries down the main diagonal.
    * When two rows are interchanged, the determinant changes sign.
    * If either two rows or two columns are identical, the determinant equals zero.
    * If a matrix contains either a row of zeros or a column of zeros, the determinant equals zero.
    * The determinant of an inverse matrix  ùê¥‚àí1  is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix ùê¥.
    * If any row or column is multiplied by a constant, the determinant is multiplied by the same factor.</p>
